# Express
After using NodeJS, you can see that it requires a lot of complexity and can be get really messy just to do a few things. 

### What is Express?
* A really fast, very basic at the core and have full control of how you handle the request and responds. 
* A server-side framework but can be used in combination.

### Why use Express?
* Makes building web application 100x times easier
* Used for both API and microservices
* Most popular Node Framework
* Write handlers for request with different HTTP routes
* generates responses by inserting data into templates

### Express Core
* `res.send()` = to send string response. Will also end the request cycle. 
* `res.json()` = to send JSON response
* `res.sendFile()` = to send a file
* `app.all()` = will be called in response to any HTTP method. 

Has all these methods: 
```
checkout(), copy(), delete(), get(), head(), lock(), merge(), mkactivity(), mkcol(), move(), m-search(), notify(), options(), patch(), post(), purge(), put(), report(), search(), subscribe(), trace(), unlock(), unsubscribe().
```
An example:
```
app.all('/secret', function(req, res, next) {
  console.log('Accessing the secret section ...');
  next(); // pass control to the next handler
});
```
* Routing allow you to match the specific URL name you want and to do action with it

### Adding folders in Routing
* Type `const router = express.Router()` and use that instead of `app.get()` would be how you add routes. The route `/app` would then become ``host/router/app"
* You will have a new file specifically called say `wiki.js` and export the `router`. Then to use it, you will simply write in the main file `app.use("/wiki", wiki)`

### Using Middleware
* An express application is really just a series of middleware function calls
* Middleware can perform any operation, execute any code, make changes to the request and response objects, also end the request-response cycle
* If not end, you must call `next()` to pass control to next middleware function
* Be aware of the order you place your middleware. If session middleware depend on cookie middleware, then cookie handler must be added first. 
* If `next()` is not called, then the request is left hanging.
* OFten the case that middleware are called before setting routes
* The difference between a `middleware function` and a `route handler callback` is that the middleware function must have a third argument `next` which are expected to call to complete the request cycle.

``` 
// this will be used by all routes
app.use(middlewareFunction)

// specify a specific route to be used
app.use("/someroute", middlewareFunction")

// can add middleware for specific HTTP verb
app.get(middlewareFunction)

// can specify the specific route for HTTP verb
app.get("/route", middlewareFunctiom)

```

* Application-level middleware: using the `app` 
* writing `next("route")` will automatically skip to the next route stack. 


### Middleware as a array
Declare the middleware substack as a array to allow for resuability
```
const logOriginalURL = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("original:", req.originalUrl);
  next();
};
const logMethod = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("method:", req.method);
  next();
};
const middlewareArray = [logOriginalURL, logMethod];
app.get("/about", middlewareArray, (req, res, next) => {
  res.send("GAME OVER");
});
```

### Error Handling
Define your middleware function as usual but now with four arguments:
```
app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  console.error(err.stack)
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!')
})
```

### Basic Route Handling
* Handling requests/routes is simple
* app
