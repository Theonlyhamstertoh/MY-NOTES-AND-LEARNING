To use THREE
```
npm i three
import * as THREE from "three";
```

## Scene
Consider what a movie scene is. You have your actors, lights, buildings, right? Same in JS but with objects and shading.

## Objects
Can create objects from
* Primitive geometries
* Imported models from like blender
* Particles
* Lights
* ETC

## Mesh
Class representing triangular polygon mesh. It's a combination of geometry (shape) and material (the color of shape)

### BoxGeometry
All of these are optional. By default, it is all pointed towards 1. 
```
THREE.BoxGeometry(
  width: float, * meaning main ones
  height: float, *
  depth (z): Float, *
  widthSegments: Integer, 
  heightSegments: Integer, 
  depthSegment: Integer);
```

To create a geometry, write `const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);`
