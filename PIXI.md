## Application
A application is the controller of the canvas. It is made up of: renderer, ticker, and container. Similar to THREEJS set up. That means, behind the scene, you really are creating three things with this, making life a little easier for you. In the future, if you have big projects, it may be beneficial to have multiple renderers and in that case, you will have to create your own.
