# MY-NOTES-AND-LEARNING
This is a collection of all the notes I have thus far written in programming. I have written a great deal in my notebook and now am switching to using github to store them in a cleaner format. The notes are taken from courses, stackoverflow, videos, reading, docs, and so forth.
