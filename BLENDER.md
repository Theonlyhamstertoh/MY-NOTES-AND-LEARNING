## To Split
* Go to the corner and drag. 
* To remove a split, drag to the nearby screen and ti will combine

# Tons of shortcut
* Can be extremely useful to master
* Always an alternative through the interface.
* If you want to be productive, you have to learn them.
* Shortcuts are *area* sensitive. If your `mouse` is in the 3D viewport, it will do shortcuts only for the 3D viewport. *Make sure they are in the right area*
